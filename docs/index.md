## Calm control for adult life

Life Admin Control Center keeps track of the high-stakes “boring” tasks — lease notices, license renewals, insurance deadlines, visa paperwork, dentist visits, medication refills — and warns you before they become expensive. Every reminder includes the exact script, email, or checklist you need so you just click send.
